# About Me:
ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 19 year old, undergraduate student from India with A+ taste in music and books and shows.

- *Despite my best attempts to be a generalist when it comes to programming I like doing things in python a little too much.*

- *Also among other things I really, really enjoy working with stuff relating to Linux systems and networking (and some light cybersecurity too ðŸ¤ ).*

- *I'm currently busy organising [OSDHack](https://github.com/osdc/OSDHack-23/). Participate if you can!*
